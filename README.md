# time-guide

Cosmic horror is the unsettling feeling that arises from contemplating the vastness of the Cosmos and the secrets that lie within it. The artist Trevor Paglen makes the boundaries of secret government programs and facilities known by photographing the physical spaces they inhabit. This exposes an inherent contradiction of what is supposed to be secret and unknowable as, in fact, existing. time-guide reveals the approximate positions and observability of the planets through data queried from public APIs. Only in the space age have humans been able to truly continuously monitor the solar system rather than relying on predictions. Rationally speaking, a continuous observation of the planets would be no more interesting than the continuous monitoring of any building that protects secret government programs. Does directly observing the motions of the planets make us feel any more secure from the terror of the Universe''s secrets? Just as photographs of secret government sites makes us feel a sense of agency by revealing the extent to which they are knowable, time-guide gives us some comfort that the Cosmos, through being quantified, can be known.
